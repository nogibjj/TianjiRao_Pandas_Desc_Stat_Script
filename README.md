## **Report**
## Week 2 Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script 

This repo contains:   
- .devcontainer     
- .github   
- .gitignore    
- Makefile  
- README.md     
- requirements.txt      
- main.py   
- test_main.py

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is using the `Pandas` to show statistics descriptions. The author use a `pd.DataFrame` as a sample data and test its descriptions using the function `desc_df()`. The visualization focus on the bar plot, using `bar_plot()`. Both functions are tested in test_main.py.

## Dataset
The experimental dataset is Eletric Vehicle Population Data that provided by DATA.GOV. Here I downloaded the .csv file and made it the dataset for testing.
The url address is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data. 
I used `pd.read_csv()` to read this dataset and save as a `pd.DataFrame`.

## Functions
There are two main functions in the `main.py`:
- desc_df(): this function can take a DataFrame as the input and return a statistical description summary based on the method `pd.DataFrame.describe()`. The default output of `describe()` can return a list of statistics including: `count`, `mean`, `std`, `min`, `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, and `max` (fullfill the requirements, which are mean, median, and standard deviation). 

- bar_plot(): the `bar_plot()` function also take a DataFrame as the input and will plot of bar plot of the input data. This function is mainly based on the `pd.DataFrame.plot()`. Here, we set the `kind = bar` so we can get the desired bar plot.


## Preparation
1. Setting up Codespaces
2. Check `make` operations


## Check format and test errors
1. Format `make format`
2. Lint `make lint`
